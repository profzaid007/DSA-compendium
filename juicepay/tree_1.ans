You need to define three operations on it

1. lock(X, uid)
2. unlock(x, uid)
3. upgradeLock(x, uid)

where X the name of a node in the tree (that would be unique) and uid is the user who is performing the operation.

Here are the definitions for the Operations:

Lock(x, uid)

Lock takes an exclusive access on the subtree rooted at X. It is formally defined like this: Once lock(x, uid) succeeds, then:

· lock(A, anyUserid) should fail (returns false), where A is a descendent of X,
. lock(B, anyUserld) should fail (returns false), where X is a descendent of B
. Lock operation cannot be performed on a node which is already locked i.e. lock(x, anyUserld) should fail (returns false).

Unlock(X, uid)

. Unlock reverts what was done by the lock operation. It can only be called on same node on which user uid had called a Lock on before. Returns true
if it is successful.

UpgradeLock(x, uid)

. It helps the user uid upgrade their lock to an ancestor node. It is only possible if the node X already has locked descendants and all of them are only
locked by the same user uid. Upgrade should fail if there is any node which is descendant of X that is locked by a different user. Successful Upgrade
will 'lock' the node. UpgradeLock call shouldn't violate the consistency model that Lock/Unlock function requires.

Notes

1) The number of nodes in the tree N is very large. So, optimize the time complexity for the above algorithms

2) The below section contains the input format.

. The first line contains the number of Nodes in the tree (N).
. The second line contains number of children per node (value m in m-ary Tree).
. The third line contains number of queries (Q).
. Next N lines contains the NodeName (string) in the m-Ary Tree.
. Next Q lines contains queries which are in format: Operation Type NodeName Userld
. Operation Type -
1 for Lock

2 for unlock

3 for upgradeLock

. NodeName - Name of any node (unique) in m-Ary Tree.
· Userld - Integer value representing a unique user.
